# Deep Learning Specialization (deeplearning.AI)

A repository that contains my completed Jupyter Notebooks for all five courses of the Deep Learning Specialization offered by deeplearning.AI on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

Specifically, the five courses covered in this repository are:

- Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep learning
- Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks
- Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Course 5: Sequence Models

This repository was created for academic purposes only, so that I have one place to review all of the specialization's material.  

Please follow Coursera's Honor Code if reviewing this repository.

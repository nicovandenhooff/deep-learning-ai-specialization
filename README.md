# General info
A repository that contains my completed Jupyter Notebooks for all five courses of the Deep Learning Specialization offered by deeplearning.AI on Coursera.

Specifically, the five courses covered in this repository are:
- Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep learning
- Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks
- Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
- Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Course 5: Sequence Models

This repository was created for academic purposes only, in order for myself to have one place to review all of the specialization's material.  Please follow Coursera's Honor Code if reviewing this repository.
